# About
Movie Reservation System is a comprehensive platform designed to provide users with a seamless and engaging movie ticket reservation experience. The system allows users to explore a diverse range of movies, search by title, filter based on genres, actors, or dates, and choose their preferred seats for specific showtimes. Payments are securely processed using **Stripe**, with an additional option for cash payments. To enhance user experience, the platform includes a robust Customer Support Chat feature powered by **Socket.IO**, enabling real-time communication with customer service. This feature is further enhanced by an automated chatbot utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to handle common queries intelligently, offering instant assistance before escalating to a human agent if needed.
The project is built with **TypeScript** to ensure strong typing and maintainable code, leveraging **Node.js** for the backend. Critical functionalities include user authentication, movie listing and filtering, seat selection, and reservation management, seamlessly linking users, movies, and seats. **Nodemailer** is integrated for sending email notifications, such as ticket confirmations and updates, while the review system allows users to provide feedback, enhancing the platformâ€™s quality. The system is further enriched with efficient payment handling, supporting both online and offline methods, and an intuitive ticketing module for tracking and managing reservations.
