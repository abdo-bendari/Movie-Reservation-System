# About
Movie Reservation System is a comprehensive platform designed to provide users with a seamless and engaging movie ticket reservation experience. The system allows users to explore a diverse range of movies, search by title, filter based on genres, actors, or dates, and choose their preferred seats for specific showtimes. Payments are securely processed using **Stripe**, with an additional option for cash payments. To enhance user experience, the platform includes a robust Customer Support Chat feature powered by **Socket.IO**, enabling real-time communication with customer service. This feature is further enhanced by an automated chatbot utilizing **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to handle common queries intelligently, offering instant assistance before escalating to a human agent if needed.
The project is built with **TypeScript** to ensure strong typing and maintainable code, leveraging **Node.js** for the backend. Critical functionalities include user authentication, movie listing and filtering, seat selection, and reservation management, seamlessly linking users, movies, and seats. **Nodemailer** is integrated for sending email notifications, such as ticket confirmations and updates, while the review system allows users to provide feedback, enhancing the platformâ€™s quality. The system is further enriched with efficient payment handling, supporting both online and offline methods, and an intuitive ticketing module for tracking and managing reservations.
With its modular and scalable architecture, the Movie Reservation System delivers a user-friendly and reliable experience, making it a perfect solution for moviegoers and administrators alike.
